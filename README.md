Hello, thank you for taking the time to look at this repository.
This is an incredibly basic cli based rpg game that I'm making. Truthfully, I started writing this a while ago, when I was much newer to C++, and shamefully never finished it. I've been looking through
a lot of my code recently, and now I am planning on finishing this, but right now it's a massive work in progress.
Thank you.
